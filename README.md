## Contributors

**Bogdan**:

- Created launcher app
- Built Tic-tac-toe and Sudoku games
- Fixed bugs for platform compatibility and docker
- Challenges met: getting used to the **tkinter** interface and reduced number of widgets + developing the Sudoku generation algorithm
- Solutions: Generating the table line by line with verifications at each step. If verification fails, the line is regenerated


**Cezar**:

- Developed Asteroids and Wordle games
- Fixed bugs for launcher integration
- Challenges met: Familiarizing with the Pygame library and resolving the *"bullet not in list"* error for multiple collisions in the Asteroids game + optimising performance of Asteroids.
- Solutions: Check if bullet is in list + deleting entities that go offscreen


**Vlad**:

- Developed Dice Game and Snake Game
- Fixed display bugs and system compatibility issues
- Challenges met: Familiarizing with the Pygame library, every time the *run_snake* function was imported in launcher, generating and empty Pygame window + making a graphic selection screen for Snake skins + making the rolling hand GIF play in Dice Game
- Solutions: Encapsulated the pygame initialisation and window creation in the *run_snake* command to generate a new window every run + generating a triangle that moves to the center of the selected text for the snake's skin + rendering the GIF's frame one at a time
